// Typing the template name followed by `.ejs` everytime is annoying
// This lets express/our app know that if we try to render a view
// and we do not provide a file extension (like .ejs), our app
// should assume by default that the extension is .ejs
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

// STATIC ASSETS
// Use `path.join` to combine string arguments into directory paths
// For Example:
// path.join('/', 'Users', 'bob'); // => '/Users/bob'

// `__dirname` is a global variable available anywherer in any applicaiton
// that is run by Node that returns the full directory path beginning from
// root (i.e. '/') to the location of the file where `__dirname` is used.
// console.log('__dirname:', __dirname);

// The static assets middleware will take all the files and directories
// at a specified path and serve them publically with their own URL.
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
// The line above connects our `public` directory to express
// so that it can serve the browser those images/css files/ bropwser-side

// MIDDLEWARE
// ----------

// LOGGER
// app.use is a method that states we would like to call the
// callback function given to use with  every single request
// In this case, logger('dev') reeturns to us that callback
// to be called later, since logger is a higher order function
app.use(logger('dev'));

// BODY PARSER / URLENCODED
// This middleware will decode the data that was submitted
// from the form using the "POST" HTTP verb

// When the "extended" option is set to `true`, it will allow
// form data to tak the shape of arrays
// or objects. But if set to `false`, you can only get string from
// form data.
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
// It will modify the `request` object given to routes
// by adding a property to it named `body`
// `request.body` will be an object containing the data from our form

// METHOD OVERRIDE
app.use(
	methodOverride((req, res) => {
		if (req.body && req.body._method) {
			const method = req.body._method;
			return method;
		}
	}),
);

// COOKIE PARSER
app.use(cookieParser());
// What cookieParser does as a middleware is modify the request and response objects
// that are given to all of our routes
// it adds a property to the request object named `cookies` which is an object itself
// of key value pairs
// it adds a method to response object called cookie()
// which we will use to set cookies

// CUSTOM MIDDLEWARE
app.use((request, response, next) => {
	// console.log('cookies:', request.cookies);
	// Read cookies from the request using `request.cookies`
	// They're represented by an object whose properties are cookie-names
	// and the values associated with those properties are the corresponding
	// cookie values
	// The is only available when "cookie-parser" middleware is installed and setup.
	const username = request.cookies.username;

	// Set properties on `response.locals` to create variables that
	// are global and available to all of the rendered templates.
	response.locals.loggedInUserName = username || '';

	// The third argument to all middlewars is a callback function
	// named "next". When called, it tells Express that this middleware is complete
	// and moves on to the next middleware in line, or if it is the last middleware
	// begins looking for the route that matches the request
	next();
});

// ------
// ROUTES
// ------

const postsRouter = require('./routes/postsRouter');
// All requests that being with the path "/posts" should be sent
// and handled by the postsRouter
// In addition, any route defined within the postsRouter
// will automatically have "/posts" prepended to the path specified
// within that route
app.use('/posts', postsRouter);

const baseRouter = require('./routes/baseRouter');
// the baseRouter defined within and exported from `routes/baseRouter.js`
// is being "hooked up" to our app in the line of code below
// This says that all requests with any HTTP verb, and to any path beginning
// with  "/" should be handled by the baseRouter
app.use('/', baseRouter);
